# Covid-19 Global Tracker

This is R code to make animated maps tracking the novel coronavirus outbreak on a global, country-level scale. The data is from Johns Hopkins University and was compiled by [RxDataScience](https://www.rxdatascience.com/covid-19).

Lots of room for improvement here, but figured this was a decent start. Main things that could be added/edited:
* Fill in missing country data
* Fix background coloring
* Add in some smoother/better transition effects

Feel free to edit as you see fit.
